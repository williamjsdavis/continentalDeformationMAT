utrue = exp(X+Y/2);        % true solution for test problem

% set boundary conditions around edges of usoln array:

usoln = utrue;              % use true solution for this test problem
                            % This sets full array, but only boundary values
                            % are used below.  For a problem where utrue
                            % is not known, would have to set each edge of
                            % usoln to the desired Dirichlet boundary values.


% adjust the rhs to include boundary terms:
rhs(:,1) = rhs(:,1) - usoln(Iint,1)/h^2;

% convert the 2d grid function rhs into a column vector for rhs of system:
F = reshape(rhs,m*m,1); % Can also use F = rhs(:);

% form matrix A:
I = speye(m);

T = spdiags([e -4*e e],[-1 0 1],m,m);
S = spdiags([e e],[-1 1],m,m);
A = (kron(I,T) + kron(S,I)) / h^2;


% Solve the linear system:
uvec = A\F;  

% reshape vector solution uvec as a grid function and 
% insert this interior solution into usoln for plotting purposes:
% (recall boundary conditions in usoln are already set) 

usoln(Iint,Jint) = reshape(uvec,m,m);

% assuming true solution is known and stored in utrue:
err = max(max(abs(usoln-utrue)));   
fprintf('Error relative to true solution of PDE = %10.3e \n',err)
